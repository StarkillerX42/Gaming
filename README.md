# Gaming
This is a repository to download my Overwatch Rank daily, and create a plot of it. It can easily be replaced with another person's account if you modify the url in get_ow_ranks.py. Weird things happen between seasons, but they are inherent and are resolved in the plotting methods.

## TODO
Add Counterstrike to this and track both ranks in the same repo.
